Problem: Largest Block

Problem Description:
Given a square matrix with the elements 0 or 1, write a program
to find a maximum square submatrix whose elements are all 1s. Your program
should prompt the user to enter the number of rows in the matrix. The program
then displays the location of the first element in the maximum square submatrix
and the number of the rows in the submatrix. 

Here is a sample run:

```
Enter the number of rows in the matrix: 5
Enter the matrix row by row:
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1

The maximum square submatrix is at (2, 2) with size 3
```
